# Oxlip

A poor failing attemp to create another frontend layout framework

## Why anothor framework?

You may ask if it is another poor attemp, then why doing this?

Because this supposed to be my homework for "Internet Engineering" course of University of Guilan, and they don't accept using Bootstrap or anyother front-end framework. That's why.

## Where did you find that logo?

I created that by myself using Gravit Designer. You can use it for your own projects tho.
