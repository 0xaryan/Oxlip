Another failing poor attemp to create another frontend layout framework

## Why anothor framework?

You may ask, if it is anothrt poor attemp, then why doing this?

Because this supposed to be my homework for "Internet Engineering" course of University of Guilan, and they don't accept using Bootstrap or anyother front-end framework. That's why.
